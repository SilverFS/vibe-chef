The Vibe Chef is a Discord bot written in [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) for the purpose of learning JavaScript and developing a new Discord bot with another language (I used to use Discord.py). 


## Installation

1. Download the zip file by cloning this project.
2. Extract this zip file in a convenient folder. 
3. Copy the file: "src/Data/config.json.example" and rename the copied file by deleting ".example".
4. Replace the token and prefix to your personal ones. 
5. Use `npm install` to install all neccesary packages.
6. Use `npm run dev` to start the bot in developer mode.
